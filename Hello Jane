Part One -- Life At Gatesherd
Chapter One
The Fight
  We couldn't go outside at all on the cold, rainy afternoon. The rain was pouring down, the wind was blowing hard. I didn't care. I was happy to stay indoors. Trying to take long walks in the winter was terrible! It was supposed to be healthy for our bodies, but I hated coming home in the dark with my feet and hands as cold as ice. And I was always unhappy because Bessie, one of the servants, was always scolding me. I had always known that I was different from my cousins, John, Eliza, and Georgiana Reed. They were prettier and taller than I, and everyone loved them.
